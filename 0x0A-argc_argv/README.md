This repository exists to show excersies done for ALX about argc and argv


if you are confused about 4-add, 
it works because you must view the array as 
a 2 dimensional array, each string or argument
in the array is a new set of array so to check 
if it's a digit or not i'd need to further check
inside their individual arrays.
